Install:
========
Python 2.7 has to be installed. Currently no Python 3 support, because some needed libraries aren't ported to Python 3 yet.

    1) git clone https://github.com/mr-georgebaker/pygraph.git
    2) change to the new directory
    3) chmod +x pygraphy.py

OR

    1) Download the complete repository as a .zip file and unpack
    2) change to the new directory
    3) chmod +x pygraph.py

Needed libraries:
=================
Numpy<br>
Matplotlib<br>

Usage:
======
Either see usage.txt or save the usage.txt file in the same directory as pygraph.py and see "Help" -> "Usage"

For example:

f(x) = sin(x)/2 <br>
f(x) = arcsin(x^2)<br>
f(x) = x^3+3*x^2+x<br>
f(x) = 3x^2+x<br>
